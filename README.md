DigDug Recreation
============

This project was part of my final assessment for my Game Development minor, where we were tasked with recreating a classic game from scratch. I chose DigDug, a timeless arcade game where players dig through the earth to defeat enemies by inflating them until they explode. The game combines strategy, quick reflexes, and challenging gameplay in an underground setting.
I've gained valuable insights throughout this project, and I am continuously updating it to ensure high code quality and improve the overall experience.

This experience has significantly expanded my development skills, including mastering OOP-based code organization and integrating external libraries with my own code. I’ve implemented advanced design patterns, such as the state machine, to manage complex game logic, and utilized inheritance to promote code reusability and maintainability. Additionally, I’ve applied other programming principles and techniques to improve the overall structure and performance of the game.

Exciting updates are on the way! Follow along as I refine the gameplay, enhance AI behavior, and introduce brand-new features.

## Key Learnings
- Mastered tilemap creation from scratch, utilizing various tiles with different rigidbodies and colliders for dynamic gameplay environments.
- Implemented state machine-driven characters, including both the player and monsters, to manage complex state transitions and behaviors.
- Utilized Unity’s Sprite Editor for efficient sprite slicing and animation setup.
- Developed a deep understanding of animation controllers, employing event-based animations to create smooth and reactive gameplay visuals.
- Designed and programmed AI-driven monsters with unique behaviors that adapt to player actions and interactions.
- Integrated event-driven sound systems to enhance the player experience with responsive audio cues.
- Explored Unity's Canvas properties to display and manage critical UI elements, such as score and health, effectively.
- Applied object-oriented principles, including inheritance and abstract classes, to create scalable and maintainable code architecture.
